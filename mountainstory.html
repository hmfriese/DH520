<p>I am tentative to describe any one place as home, although Calgary is likely the closest I have come to being ‘from’ a place. My birth certificate says I am from Edmonton, but I don’t feel any attachment to it. This is primarily because my family moved frequently while I was growing up. The most resonant factor amongst all of the places I have lived is the winter. Cold days, snow for much of the year, and afternoon sunsets are the threads that bind the patchwork of the places I’ve lived. This amongst other reasons is why I love a frigid winters day after a fresh foot of snow like nothing else.</p>

<p>The sheer length of time I spent in Calgary means that my conceptions of home have become tied to that city, and even more so, the mountains to the west. Hiking is my activity of choice for the summer, and winter has become synonymous with skiing. The mountains surrounding Banff and Lake Louise have become a second home, quite often literally, as the nights I have spent in a tent in these places likely numbers itself almost into the hundreds by now. Although knowledge of a space is not a substitute for truly being from or of a place, it has been as good a replacement for a feeling of home as I could hope for.

<p>I spend a great deal of my summers hiking in the Banff and Lake Louise area and have come to know the local flora and fauna well. For the past few years, identifying wildflowers has become a hobby on the trails. Any trail that boasts a showing of fleabane or asters is a favorite of mine, although I’ve only recently truly been able to tell them apart. For the non-botanist fleabanes and asters are relatively difficult to distinguish. Both look a bit like a purply-white daisy with each species having a similar number of petals as well as leaf formation. For years I thought that I could tell them apart but a recent hike to Taylor Lake and conversation with my partner about how to distinguish them taught me that we were both wrong. I used to think that fleabane simply grew in small bunches and that asters had a single bloom per stem and were taller. My partner had thought the opposite was true. To check our knowledge we flipped through our well-loved copy of the Handbook of the Canadian Rockies. We discovered that the primary tool for telling the two flowers apart is to “Look at the little green cup under the flower—the scaly involucral bracts. If the bracts are all the same length it is a fleabane. If some bracts are obviously shorter it is an aster” (Gadd, 306). </p>
